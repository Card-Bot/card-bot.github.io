    <h2>Rules of CardBot Battle</h2><br>
    <p>CardBot battle is a turn-based card game, where to opponents with 1 card each take turns to build attack and defense, and destroy the opponent</p>
    <br>
    <p>First, two players start a battle with <b>c.battle</b> and <b>c.accept (CHALLENGER USERNAME)</b></p>
    <p>Second, one player is randomely chosen to go first. It does not matter who goes first, because both players go before the attack phase begins</p>
    <p>The player who goes gets a certain amount of turns, depending on the card. If they type <b>1</b>, attack will increase the the incremental amount, also designated in the <a href="https://card-bot.github.io/api/tutorial/">Search API</a></p>
    <p>Do not worry about the opponent seeing what you do, the bot deletes the message immediately</p>
    <p>Third, the second player goes, doing the same thing</p>
    <p>Last, the attack is subtracted from the opponents defense they had, and then dealt to them, and vice-versa.</p>
    <p>This process repeats until 1 player's card dies</p>
    <p>That is it!</p><br>
    <h3>More Info</h3>
    <p>The amount of moves a card gets depends on the rarity, unless specified otherwise</p>
